# Automating SUMO traffic demand generation [STG] #

STG allows to SUMO users to quickly and easily execute generate traffic demnd for their own sceanrios (i.e., net file). 
This is an automation tool for SUMO that generate required confgiration files for SUMO tools. 
Based on SUMO templates structure, this tool reads templates folder and generate configration files  and execute simulations.
Required inputs include: SUMO valid installation, .ned (road network), real traffic (.csv), origin/destination zones (TAZs).

STG includes the following tool:    
```bash
  - run: Generates traffic demand based on the selected SUMO tool. Executes simulations.
```

```bash
    # stg run --help

```

## Clone the repository ##
The STG package is developed using a pipenv. TO install osm on a virtual environment:
```bash
pip3 install pipenv
```

To clone the osm repository, on the command line, enter:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Pbarbecho/STG.git
```
On the new venv, install osm project in an editable mode:

```bash
pipenv install -e stg/
```

Then, for use the new virtual environment instantiate a sub-shell as follows:

```bash
pipenv shell
```

At this time, you can interact with the STG modules.

## Downloading modules ##

Install osm using pip:
```bash
pip3 install --user -U https://github.com/Pbarbecho/osm/archive/master.zip
```

Depending on the operating system, you may need to add ~/.local/bin to your path. During the installation you will be warned about this.
 
 
In case you want to uninstall osm package: 

```bash
pip3 uninstall stg
```
